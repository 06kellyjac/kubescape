Kubescape is the first tool for testing if Kubernetes is deployed securely as defined in [Kubernetes Hardening Guidance by to NSA and CISA](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2716980/nsa-cisa-release-kubernetes-hardening-guidance/)
Tests are configured with YAML files, making this tool easy to update as test specifications evolve.

# TL;DR
## Installation
To install the tool locally, run this:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armosec/kubescape/master/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

## Run
To get a fast check of the security posture of your Kubernetes cluster, run this:

```
kubescape scan framework nsa --exclude-namespaces kube-system,kube-public
```

If you wish to scan all namespaces in your cluster, remove the `--exclude-namespaces` flag.

# Under the hood

## Tests
Kubescape is running the following tests according to what is defined by [Kubernetes Hardening Guidance by to NSA and CISA](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2716980/nsa-cisa-release-kubernetes-hardening-guidance/)
* Non-root containers
* Immutable container filesystem 
* Privileged containers 
* hostPID, hostIPC privileges
* hostNetwork access
* allowedHostPaths field
* Protecting pod service account tokens
* Resource policies
* Control plane hardening 
* Exposed dashboard


## Technology
Kubescape based on OPA engine: https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa and ARMO's posture controls. 

The tools retrieves Kubernetes objects from the API server and runs a set of [regos snippets](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/) developed by [ARMO](https://www.armosec.io/). 

The results by default printed in a pretty "console friendly" manner, but they can be retrieved in JSON format for further processing.

Kubescape is an open source project, we welcome your feedback and ideas for improvement. Weâ€™re also aiming to collaborate with the Kubernetes community to help make the tests themselves more robust and complete as Kubernetes develops.
